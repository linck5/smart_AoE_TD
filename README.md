<h1>Tower defense with smart AoE towers</h1>

In this TD game prototype, towers shoot a bullet that damages enemies in an AoE at the end of its path. The towers will always shoot in a point where the maximum number of enemies possible are hit. It lacks some optimization, as the program may freeze for a bit before shooting a bullet when there are many enenies on the screen
